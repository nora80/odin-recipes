    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>
    <p>Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking since his college days.
         Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. What is posted here will easily serve eight people.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
        <li> pound ground beef chuck
        <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)
        <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put pasta water on to boil</li>
        <li>Brown the ground beef</li>
        <li>Cook the bell pepper, onions, garlic, add back the beef</li>
    </ol>
